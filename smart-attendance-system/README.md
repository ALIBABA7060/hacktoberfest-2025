# Smart Attendance System

Goal
- Face/QR check-in system with automatic logging to Google Sheets and a teacher dashboard.

Suggested tech
- Frontend: React + camera/QR scanner (html5-qrcode)
- Backend: Flask / Node.js for processing & Google Sheets integration
- ML: face recognition via OpenCV / face-api.js (optional)

Starter tasks
- Create QR check-in UI and server endpoint
- Integrate Google Sheets API to log attendance
- Create a simple dashboard to view logs

Good first tasks
- Implement a minimal QR scanner page that posts check-in to an endpoint
- Add a script to append rows to a test Google Sheet (instructions for service account)
