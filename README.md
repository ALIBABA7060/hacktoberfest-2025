2. Comment on the issue to let maintainers know you're working on it (optional but polite).
3. Fork the repository to your GitHub account.
4. Create a branch with a descriptive name.
5. Make commits with clear messages.
6. Push the branch to your fork and open a Pull Request (PR) against this repository.
7. Follow review comments and update the PR until itâ€™s merged.

## Contribution workflow â€” step-by-step with git commands

Replace the placeholders (YOUR_USERNAME, ISSUE_NUMBER, feature/short-desc) with your own values.

1. Fork the repo on GitHub:
   - Click "Fork" in the top-right corner of the repo page.

2. Clone your fork locally:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/hacktoberfest-2025.git
cd hacktoberfest-2025
```

3. Set the original repo as `upstream` (so you can pull new changes later):
```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/hackdaydvsiet-debug/hacktoberfest-2025.git
git fetch upstream
```

4. Create a new branch for your work (use a descriptive branch name):
```bash
# Start from the latest main
git checkout main
git pull upstream main

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-short-description
```

5. Make changes locally. Stage and commit them:
```bash
git add path/to/changed-file
git commit -m "feat: add X feature to Y (closes #ISSUE_NUMBER)"
```
- Use conventional, meaningful commit messages.
- If you're addressing an issue, include "closes #ISSUE_NUMBER" or "fixes #ISSUE_NUMBER".

6. Push your branch to your fork:
```bash
git push origin feature/your-short-description
```

7. Open a Pull Request:
- Go to your fork on GitHub.
- Click "Compare & pull request".
- Choose the base repository `hackdaydvsiet-debug/hacktoberfest-2025` and base branch `main`.
- Fill the PR template (see guidance below) and create the PR.

---

## Branching & commit message guidelines

- Branch names: feature/..., fix/..., docs/..., chore/...
  - Example: `feature/add-contributor-guide`, `fix/typo-readme`
- Commit messages:
  - Short summary (max 50 chars)
  - Optionally a longer description after a blank line
  - Include issue references when applicable: `closes #12`
  - Example: `docs: update contributing instructions for git setup`

---

## PR template & what to include

When you open a PR, include:
- A short description of the change.
- The issue number it addresses (if any).
- Steps to reproduce / test instructions.
- Screenshots (if UI changes).
- Any assumptions or design decisions.

Example PR title:
```
feat: add CONTRIBUTING.md and README improvements (closes #34)
```

Example PR body:
- What I changed and why
- How to test locally:
```bash
# example steps
npm install
npm test
```
- Related issue: #34

## Keeping your fork and branch up-to-date

If the upstream repository changes while you work, update your branch before opening or updating a PR.

Option A â€” Merge upstream main into your branch:
```bash
# on your main
git checkout main
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
git push origin main

# update your feature branch
git checkout feature/your-short-description
git merge main
# resolve conflicts if any, then:
git push origin feature/your-short-description
```

Option B â€” Rebase your branch on latest main (cleaner history):
```bash
git fetch upstream
git checkout feature/your-short-description
git rebase upstream/main
# resolve conflicts if any, then:
git push --force-with-lease origin feature/your-short-description
```
Note: Use force-push only if you understand rewriting history and you're the only one working on the branch.

## Labels, issues, and what to pick

- `good first issue` â€” beginner-friendly tasks.
- `help wanted` â€” tasks maintainers want help with.
- `enhancement` â€” new features or improvements.
- `bug` â€” bug fixes.

If you don't find an issue that fits, open a new issue describing the improvement you want to make. Maintainers will label it appropriately.

---

## Code of Conduct

Be respectful and inclusive. Follow standard open-source etiquette:
- Be kind in comments and PR reviews.
- Aim to help teammates learn.
- If you encounter harassment or policy violations, contact the maintainers.

(You can add a detailed CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md in the repo â€” contributions welcome.)

---

## Licenses & credit

By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be available under the project's license. If a LICENSE file exists, refer to it for details. If not, contact maintainers.

---

## Troubleshooting & tips

- Make small, focused PRs â€” easier to review and merge.
- Run linters/tests locally if available before opening a PR.
- If you're unsure, open an issue and discuss the change first.

Useful Git commands (quick reference):
```bash
# check remotes
git remote -v

# create a branch
git checkout -b branch-name

# see status and staged files
git status
git add .
git commit -m "message"

# update from upstream
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main

# push changes
git push origin branch-name
```
