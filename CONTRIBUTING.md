# Contributing to Hacktoberfest 2025 â€” Campus Tech

Thanks for your interest! This guide explains how to contribute and what maintainers expect.

## Before you start
- Pick one issue and comment "I'd like to work on this" so maintainers can assign it.
- Fork the repo and develop in the matching folder (e.g., `/club-events-hub`).

## Branch naming
- feature/<short-description> (new feature)
- fix/<issue-number>-<short-description> (bugfix)
Example:
```bash
git checkout -b feature-digital-noticeboard-ui
```

## Pull request checklist
- Link the PR to the issue (e.g., "Fixes #5").
- Include a short description of what you changed and why.
- Add test steps (how to run locally).
- Update or add documentation if needed (README in the project folder).
- Keep commits small and focused.

## Review process
- Maintainers will review your PR and request changes if necessary.
- Once approved and CI passes, a maintainer will merge.

## Good-first-issue guidance
- If an issue is labeled `good first issue`, it is intentionally scoped for newcomers.
- If you need help, ask in the issue comments.

## Contact / Mentoring
- Maintainers will add a mentor/assignee to issues for guidance.
- If you want to be a mentor, comment here and we will add your GitHub handle to mentor list.
