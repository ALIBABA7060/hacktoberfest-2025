# Beginner DSA for Hacktoberfest

Welcome to the Beginner DSA repository! This repository is designed for beginners to practice their Data Structures and Algorithms skills and participate in Hacktoberfest.

## How to Contribute

1.  **Fork this repository:** Click the "Fork" button at the top right of this page.
2.  **Clone your fork:** `git clone https://github.com/your-username/basic-dsa.git`
3.  **Choose a question:** Look at the `questions` directory and pick a question you'd like to solve.
4.  **Create a solution file:**
    *   Navigate to the `solutions` directory.
    *   Go into the folder for the language you're using (e.g., `python`, `cpp`, `java`).
    *   Create a new file named `Q<number>_<question_name>.<extension>`. For example, `Q1_odd_even_linkedlist.py`.
5.  **Write your solution:** Write your code in the newly created file. Make sure your code is well-commented and follows the coding guidelines.
6.  **Create a test file (optional but recommended):**
    *   Navigate to the `tests` directory.
    *   Create a new file with a similar naming convention, e.g., `test_Q1_odd_even_linkedlist.py`.
    *   Write tests to verify your solution.
7.  **Commit your changes:** `git commit -m "feat: Add solution for Q1 in Python"`
8.  **Push to your fork:** `git push origin main`
9.  **Create a pull request:** Go to the original repository and create a pull request.

## Folder Structure

*   `questions/`: Contains the DSA questions in Markdown format.
*   `solutions/`: Contains the solutions in different programming languages.
    *   `python/`: Python solutions.
    *   `cpp/`: C++ solutions.
    *   `java/`: Java solutions.
*   `tests/`: Contains the tests for the solutions.

## Coding Guidelines

*   Write clean, readable, and well-documented code.
*   Make sure your solution is efficient and follows best practices.
*   Add comments to explain your code, especially for complex logic.
*   If you are adding a new language, create a new folder for it under the `solutions` directory.

Happy coding and happy Hacktoberfest!
