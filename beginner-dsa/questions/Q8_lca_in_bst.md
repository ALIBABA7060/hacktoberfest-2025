# Q8: Lowest Common Ancestor in a BST

Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the BST.

The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes `p` and `q` as the lowest node in `T` that has both `p` and `q` as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).

**Example:**

Given the following BST:
```
      6
     / \
    2   8
   / \ / \
  0   4 7   9
     / \
    3   5
```

LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.
LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2.
