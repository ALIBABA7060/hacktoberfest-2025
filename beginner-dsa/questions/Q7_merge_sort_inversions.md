# Q7: Merge Sort and Counting Inversions

## Merge Sort

Implement the Merge Sort algorithm to sort an array of integers in ascending order.

## Counting Inversions

While implementing Merge Sort, count the number of inversions in the array. An inversion is a pair of indices `(i, j)` such that `i < j` and `array[i] > array[j]`.
