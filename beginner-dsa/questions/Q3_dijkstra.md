# Q3: Dijkstra's Algorithm

Given a graph and a source vertex in the graph, find the shortest paths from the source to all other vertices in the given graph.

The graph can be represented as an adjacency list or an adjacency matrix. You can assume that the graph has non-negative edge weights.

**Input:**
*   A graph with `V` vertices and `E` edges.
*   A source vertex `S`.

**Output:**
*   The shortest distance from the source vertex `S` to every other vertex.
